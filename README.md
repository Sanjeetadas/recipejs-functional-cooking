# 🍳 RecipeJS – Functional Cooking Companion

RecipeJS is a modern, front-end recipe application built using **vanilla JavaScript**, focusing on **clean architecture, functional programming, and user-friendly interactivity**.  
It allows users to browse recipes, filter and sort them, view detailed cooking steps, search in real time, and save favorites with persistent storage.

This project was developed incrementally as part of a multi-stage learning journey, culminating in a polished, production-ready application.
